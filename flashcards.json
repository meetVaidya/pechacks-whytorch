      "question": "What are the two sublayers of the Data Link Layer?",
      "answer": "The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) layer.",
      "topic": "Data Link Layer Sublayers",
      "source": "Provided Content"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main responsibility of the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer?",
      "answer": "The LLC layer is responsible for data link control, including flow and error control.",
      "topic": "LLC Layer Function",
      "source": "Provided Content"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main responsibility of the Media Access Control (MAC) layer?",
      "answer": "The MAC layer is responsible for resolving access to the shared medium.",
      "topic": "MAC Layer Function",
      "source": "Provided Content"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a multiple-access protocol used for?",
      "answer": "A multiple-access protocol is used to coordinate access to a shared link (multipoint or broadcast link) when multiple nodes are connected.",
      "topic": "Multiple-Access Protocols",
      "source": "Provided Content"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two key features of Random Access protocols?",
      "answer": "Random Access protocols have two key features: 1) there is no scheduled transmission time and 2) stations compete with each other for medium access.",
      "topic": "Random Access Protocols",
      "source": "Provided Content"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two basic modes of digital data transmission?",
      "answer": "Parallel communication and serial communication.",
      "topic": "Digital Data Communication Types",
      "source": "Lecture Note \u2013 Mr. Sarath V Sankaran , JCET"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does parallel communication transmit data?",
      "answer": "It groups several bits (e.g., 8) and sends all the bits simultaneously over multiple wires.",
      "topic": "Digital Data Communication Types",
      "source": "Lecture Note \u2013 Mr. Sarath V Sankaran , JCET"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary advantage and disadvantage of parallel transmission?",
      "answer": "Advantage: Higher speed. Disadvantage: Higher cost of cabling and is only suitable for short distances.",
      "topic": "Digital Data Communication Types",
      "source": "Lecture Note \u2013 Mr. Sarath V Sankaran , JCET"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does serial communication transmit data?",
      "answer": "It sends one data bit at a time over a single pair of wires.",
      "topic": "Digital Data Communication Types",
      "source": "Lecture Note \u2013 Mr. Sarath V Sankaran , JCET"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of using serial communication over parallel communication?",
      "answer": "Reduced cost of cabling, reduced cross-talk, inherent device characteristics, and smaller connector size for portable devices.",
      "topic": "Digital Data Communication Types",
      "source": "Lecture Note \u2013 Mr. Sarath V Sankaran , JCET"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the data-link layer?",
      "answer": "To provide node-to-node communication, delivering datagrams to the next node in the path.",
      "topic": "Data Link Layer Introduction",
      "source": "Unit 2"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two main components in data-link layer communication paths?",
      "answer": "Nodes (hosts and routers) and Links (LANs and WANs)",
      "topic": "Nodes and Links",
      "source": "Unit 2"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two main services provided by the data-link layer?",
      "answer": "Framing (encapsulation and decapsulation) and Flow Control",
      "topic": "Data Link Layer Services",
      "source": "Unit 2"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'framing' in the context of the data-link layer?",
      "answer": "Encapsulating a datagram into a frame before sending, and decapsulating it upon receiving.",
      "topic": "Framing",
      "source": "Unit 2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is 'flow control' necessary in the data-link layer?",
      "answer": "To manage the rate of frame production and consumption, preventing buffer overflow at the receiving end.",
      "topic": "Flow Control",
      "source": "Unit 2"
